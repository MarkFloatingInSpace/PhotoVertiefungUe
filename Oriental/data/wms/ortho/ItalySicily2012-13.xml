       They provide different protocols:
         for orthophotos:
         - OGC - WMS 1.3.0
         - Esri -Map Service REST
       Their OGC - WMS does not really work with GDAL, because their OGC - WMS specifies a coordinate system defined by Esri (Well-known ID 102100),
       which is equivalent to EPSG:3785, but unknown to GDAL. Thus, GDAL datasets will have an undefined coordinate system and thus be useless for our purposes.
       Also, OGC - WMS does not define reduced resolutions. Thus, MonoScope's GraphicsView will open only the full-resolution dataset.
       When zooming out, the resolution of the requested image will be too large to be allocated.
       To support OGC - WMS for zooming out, it may help to tell dataSet->RasterIO to write into a reduced-resolution buffer.
       However, the CS would still be undefined, and so we just use the Esri REST protocol.

       Using the URL, create a GDAL-XML-file using:
       gdal_translate "http://map.sitr.regione.sicilia.it/ArcGIS/rest/services/CACHED/ortofoto_ata20122013_webmercatore/MapServer?f=json" rest.xml -of WMS
       and paste the XML below. -->
