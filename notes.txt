Automatic Tie Points
	825:
	# TODO Once a good enough interior image orientation is known,
	# automatically compute additional tie points.


	859:
	# If residuals are large, then the probability of this feature match being an outlier is high.
	# TODO But how large is *large*?
	
Distortion model:
	132:
	# TODO Lens distortion parameters, not (yet) used here. Adapt this number to your distortion model.
	# Set number of parameters in chosen distortion model
	172:
	# A parameter block for distortion parameters is already defined here, but not (yet) used.
	# TODO Choose an appropriate distortion model,
	#      adapt the expected size of that parameter block in parameterBlockSizes above,
	#      and actually use that parameter block here in the computation of residuals.
	
Näherungswerte ior
	716:
	# TODO initial parameter values of the interior orientation
	# For the principal point, the image center is usually a good approximation.
    # For the focal length in [pixel], we extract the focal length equivalent to 35mm film [mm]
    # from the Exif image meta data e.g. using IrfanView.

Distortion Parameters
	737
	# TODO Distortion parameters.
    # Choose an appropriate model.
    # The number of distortion parameters stated here must match the number of distortion parameters that
    # `PerspectiveCamera` expects. The preliminary number given here only serves as a placeholder.

LSM iteration:
